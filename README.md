# RXJs Experiments

## What's this?

This is a raw repository with a vanilla JS config with webpack so I can experiment with RxJs.

## How can I use it?

You can clone the repo, fiddle with RxJS while running `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` so you have webpack serve.

## How can I contribute?

I don't really know! Any ideas? Any cool RxJs stuff you know about? :D

## License

Well, MIT, you know.
